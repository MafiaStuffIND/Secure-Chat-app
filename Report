Abstract
The Secure Chat Application is designed to provide a private communication platform with end-to-end encryption (E2EE). The application ensures that messages are encrypted on the sender’s side and decrypted only by the intended recipient, preventing unauthorized access. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cryptographic techniques to secure real-time messaging.
Introduction
In today’s digital age, secure communication is critical. Traditional chat applications are vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. This project addresses these concerns by implementing a chat system that ensures privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of messages. Key objectives include:
Real-time messaging between users
End-to-end encryption using cryptography
Secure storage of messages on the server (encrypted)
Tools Used:
Python: Programming language for backend logic
Flask-SocketIO: Enables real-time communication
Cryptography (RSA & AES): Implements end-to-end encryption
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend user interface
Steps Involved in Building the Project
Requirement Analysis: Defined the need for a secure messaging system.
Design: Created system architecture with client-server communication and encryption flow.
Key Generation & Management: Generated RSA public/private key pairs for each user and securely exchanged keys.
Message Encryption: Implemented AES encryption for messages; AES keys are shared securely using RSA.
Implementation: Developed backend with Flask-SocketIO and frontend for message exchange.
Testing: Verified real-time message delivery, encryption, and decryption correctness.
Deployment: Configured the application to run on local or cloud servers for real-time usage.
Conclusion
The Secure Chat Application successfully demonstrates end-to-end encryption for private communication. It ensures that messages are only readable by intended recipients, enhancing user privacy. This project provided hands-on experience in cryptography, real-time communication, and secure application design, with potential for future enhancements like file sharing, group chats, and multi-device support.
